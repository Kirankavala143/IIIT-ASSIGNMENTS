### 1. CSS Selector:

A CSS selector is a pattern used to target HTML elements that you want to style. Selectors tell the browser which elements the styles should apply to.

There are different types of CSS selectors:

* Element Selector: Targets the HTML elements. 
eg: p { color: red; } 

* Class Selector: Targets elements with a specific class. Classes are defined using a dot (.). 
* ID Selector: Targets an element with a specific ID, using a hash (#). 

### 2. CSS Property:

A CSS property is the aspect of an element you want to style. Properties define the changes you want to apply, such as color, font size, margin, or background. Every CSS declaration contains a property, followed by a value.

 For example: (color: red;), color is the property, which controls the text color of the selected element.

 ### 3. CSS Value:
A CSS value is the specific setting that you assign to a CSS property. It defines the appearance or behavior of the property

*eg:
color:blue;  
blue is the css value

### 4. Style Element:
The style element is used within an HTML document to embed CSS rules directly into the HTML file. Itâ€™s commonly placed inside the head section of the HTML.
