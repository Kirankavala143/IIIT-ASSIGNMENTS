<!-- #1. CSS Selector:

A CSS selector is a pattern used to target HTML elements that you want to style. Selectors tell the browser which elements the styles should apply to.

There are different types of CSS selectors:

*Element Selector: Targets the HTML elements. 
eg: p { color: red; } 
Class Selector: Targets elements with a specific class. Classes are defined using a dot (.). eg: .btn { font-size: 14px; }
ID Selector: Targets an element with a specific ID, using a hash (#). 
eg: #header { background-color: blue; }

A CSS value is the specific setting that you assign to a CSS property. It defines the appearance or behavior of the property. For example:

color: blue; — here, blue is the value that will color the text.
margin: 20px; — here, 20px is the value defining the margin size.
Values can be specific numbers, colors, or even keywords, depending on the property. For example, you can use keywords like auto or inherit in some cases.
